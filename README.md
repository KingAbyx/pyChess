# pyChess
Just a *quick* thing I threw together with tkinter.

How it works is pretty self-explanatory, first you run main.py,
then press buttons to select pieces, possible moves will be highlighted and when you select the highlighted tiles, a move is made.
Currently the game should be over when the king is taken.

To Do:
-check
-mate
-en passante
-castling
-promoting.
